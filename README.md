Buflea was running for 3 years behind screen.webhop domain to bypass net-flix region ban, 
without a single reboot. I design it for high volume truput and high connection pool.
Everyting (threads, pool, sockets bufffers kernel and user) is configurable from configuration file.
Is a modern C++ developed SOCK proxy easy to maintain and extend.
